# Documentation for the Project

## Project Overview

This project consists of a web service application that uses the FastAPI framework. The main functionality of the service is to evaluate a scoring function based on certain input parameters. This scoring function is used in a POST API endpoint called `/scoring`. The service also includes tests to ensure that the API and scoring function are working as expected.

---

## File Structure

- `main.py`: This is the main file that runs the FastAPI application.
- `scoring_model.py`: This file contains the logic for the scoring function.
- `test_scoring_model.py`: This file contains the tests for the scoring function.

---

## Key Components

### FastAPI Application (`main.py`)

This file contains the FastAPI application. It includes the following components:

- A `Param` model, which defines the expected structure of the request body for the `/scoring` endpoint.
- The `/scoring` endpoint, which accepts a POST request with a list of `Param` objects, calls the `scoring_func` function from `scoring_model.py`, and returns the results.

### Scoring Model (`scoring_model.py`)

This file contains the scoring function and related logic. It includes the following components:

- `main_class`: This class performs the following functions:
  - It initializes parameters from a JSON input and transforms them into appropriate data types.
  - The `check` method verifies that the parameters meet specific criteria.
  - The `random` method generates a random number.
- `scoring_func`: This function calls the `main_class` methods. If the check method returns true, it generates a random number. If the check method returns false, it returns an error message.

### Test Suite (`test_scoring_model.py`)

This file contains the tests for the scoring function. It includes the following components:

- `test_verification`: This class tests the `/scoring` endpoint of the FastAPI application.

## Running the Project

Before you run the project, make sure you have installed all required Python packages, such as FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, and the requests library for testing.

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command in your terminal:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

To run the tests, use the following command in your terminal:

```
python test_scoring_model.py
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure that the correct data types are passed to the `/scoring` endpoint to avoid errors.
- The scoring model expects the input parameters to meet specific criteria. If the input does not meet these criteria, the model will return an error message.
- The project does not currently include any error handling for server or connection issues. This may be something you want to add in the future.
- The project uses a random number generator in the scoring model. This means that the output will vary between runs.
